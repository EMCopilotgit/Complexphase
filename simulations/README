- `connection_evolution.py`  
  Simulates the time evolution of A(α) and A(β) using complex-valued functions. Outputs a plot saved as `connection_evolution.png` in the `figures/` folder.

   'spike_trains.py'
Generates a raster plot of spike trains,"spike_train_raster.png" in "figures" directory, across neurons,
illustrating how phase information can be encoded in spike timing
